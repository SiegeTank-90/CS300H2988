DSA: Analysis and Design : Journal Review**

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
**
This course mostly consisted of understanding different ways to store data in structure and how to increase speed for different needs. 

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
**
With each problem, I had two goals, 1 what advantages & disadvantages did it pose over all of the other methods and second, how simple to understand I could make the code. If the speed trade offs were worth the end result in complexity. 

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
**
Whenever I encountered a road block, I would review several places first lesson videos & text, second, the various code programming diagrams, c++ function website (this courses language), & w3 schools and then final form posts other discussions. 

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
**
This course was definitely important to me thinking about speed, and was also my introduction to hashtables and binary trees. While Iâ€™d work with linked lists, vectors and arrays before/

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
**
This course furthered my implementation noting code, it also while not hundred percent necessary led me to the desire to write comment directions for where you could find code segments relevant to certain things. For example when I wrote parser function, I commented the name of the document even if I felt it was obvious.
